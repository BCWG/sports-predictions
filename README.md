### Key Research Insights Applied

**Sport Selection Priority (Based on Prediction Success):**
1. **Basketball (NBA)** - 75% of studies, most research available, highest accuracy
2. **Soccer/Football** - Second most studied, EPL most popular league
3. **American Football (NFL)** - Good prediction models, 80% of studies focus on NFL

**Critical Features for ML Models:**
- **Temporal Features**: 4-game rolling averages optimal for basketball, recent form tracking, win streaks
- **Player Archetypes**: 26 data-driven clusters beyond traditional positions (elite bigs, snipers, swiss army knives)
- **Shot Location Data**: Spatial analysis across 14 court zones significantly improves predictions  
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Defensive rebounds, shooting percentages, PER, TS%, eFG% more predictive than volume stats
- **Context-Specific Stats**: Home/away/overall performance splits, venue-specific metrics
- **Head-to-Head**: Historical matchup results between specific teams
- **External Factors**: Weather conditions, player injuries, rest days, travel distance
- **Market Indicators**: Betting odds as crowd wisdom, line movement
- **Advanced Analytics**: Strength of schedule, point differentials, efficiency ratings

**Injury Prediction Insights (Critical for Player Availability):**
- **Physical Load Monitoring**: GPS tracking data, training loads, rest periods
- **Physiological Markers**: Self-perceived wellness, RPE scores, sleep quality
- **Biomechanical Screening**: Musculoskeletal tests, movement patterns, injury history
- **Environmental Context**: Playing surface, weather conditions, equipment factors
- **Predictive Performance**: Tree-based models (Random Forest/XGBoost) achieve 60% success rate for injury prediction

**ML Architecture Best Practices:**
- **Data Structure**: Chronological organization with strict time-order preservation
- **Feature Engineering**: 4-game rolling averages optimal, separate preprocessing for match vs external features
- **Model Selection**: GA-optimized neural networks, ensemble methods (XGBoost + feature selection), Naive Bayes competitive
- **Model Evaluation**: Round-by-round testing within seasons, never cross-validation, temporal validation essential
- **Performance Targets**: 67-76% accuracy achievable for NBA games, score prediction much harder than classification
- **Feature Selection**: 40% of total features typically optimal, defensive rebounds and efficiency metrics most important
- **Player Classification**: Fuzzy c-means clustering superior to traditional positions, 26 archetypes vs 5 positions

**Database Design Principles:**
- **Temporal Design**: All tables with timestamp tracking for historical analysis
- **Feature Engineering Ready**: Pre-calculated match features and team statistics
- **Multi-Sport Flexibility**: Schema supports basketball, soccer, football, baseball, cricket
- **ML Pipeline Integration**: Prediction tracking with actual vs predicted outcomes
- **Relationship Integrity**: Proper foreign keys supporting complex analytical queries

This research-driven approach ensures our platform implements proven methodologies from academic literature rather than ad-hoc solutions.
