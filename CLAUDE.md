- **Player Archetypes**: Support for 26 data-driven clusters beyond traditional 5 positions
- **Shot Location Analytics**: Spatial data structures for 14 court zones analysis
- **Efficiency Metrics**: team_stats.win_percentage, point_differential, defensive rebounds priority
- **Performance Context**: team_stats.home_wins vs away_wins, multi-context statistics (overall/home/away)
- **Head-to-Head**: match_features.head_to_head_home_wins, head_to_head_away_wins
- **External Factors**: weather table, match_features.days_since_last_match, rest day tracking
- **Market Signals**: match_features.home_win_odds, betting line movement

- **Model Evaluation**: Database supports round-by-round testing methodology, temporal validation, never cross-validation

**Academic Framework Implementation (SRP-CRISP-DM):**

1. **Domain Understanding**: Multi-sport schema supports different game characteristics
2. **Data Understanding**: Separate tables for different data granularities (player vs team vs match)
3. **Data Preparation**: match_features table separates historical averages from external features
4. **Modeling**: predictions table tracks multiple model versions and performance
5. **Evaluation**: Temporal data structure prevents time-leakage in model testing
6. **Deployment**: Database designed for incremental learning and real-time updates

### Research Validation of Database Design

**Academic Best Practices → Database Implementation:**
- ✅ **Feature Selection Critical** → Comprehensive match_features table with 20+ engineered features
- ✅ **Temporal Order Preservation** → All tables chronologically organized with strict timestamp tracking
- ✅ **Historical Averaging Required** → match_features stores pre-calculated team performance averages
- ✅ **Multi-Sport Flexibility** → Schema supports 5 major sports with sport-specific adaptations
- ✅ **External vs Match Features** → Clear separation between known-before-match and historical-average data
- ✅ **Prediction Tracking** → Full pipeline from features to predictions to actual outcomes
- ✅ **Performance Analytics** → Advanced team/player stats beyond basic win/loss records

This research foundation ensures every design decision is backed by academic evidence rather than intuition.
